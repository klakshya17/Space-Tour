## A Space Travel Website

## Challenge
This project was made as a solution to one of [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) Challenges. The challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the figma design as possible. 

The users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
#### Access the figma design files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wwxMlWV0l7XhryuVvL5kV0aELS09orOa?usp=sharing).

## Solution
Built a multi-page, fully responsive, website using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript where users can explore space travel. 
- The website has multiple tabs, through which the users can navigate across all the content.  
- The website adapts to different screen sizes including desktops, tablets and mobile devices. The layouts are designed for the optimal use of the screen size and space to display content for the user.
- The website uses animations and state description over hovered or selected elements.
- The website is built following practices for accessibilty making it easily accessible for screen readers using assistive technologies.
- The content is displayed dynamically over all the pages. The users can toggle between the various contents on a page.
